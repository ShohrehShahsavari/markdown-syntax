To create paragraphs, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text.
I really like using Markdown.

I think I'll use it to format all of my documents from now on.

To bold text, add two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase.
I just love **bold text**.
I just love __bold text__.
Love**is**bold

To italicize text, add one asterisk or underscore before and after a word or phrase.
Italicized text is the *cat's meow*.
Italicized text is the _cat's meow_.

To emphasize text with bold and italics at the same time, add three asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase.
This text is ***really important***.
This text is ___really important___.
This text is __*really important*__.
This text is **_really important_**.

**Blockquotes**:

To create a blockquote, add a > in front of a paragraph.
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.

**Blockquotes with Multiple Paragraphs**:

Blockquotes can contain multiple paragraphs. Add a > on the blank lines between the paragraphs.

**Unordered Lists**:

To create an unordered list, add dashes (-), asterisks (*), or plus signs (+) in front of line items. Indent one or more items to create a nested list.
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
- Fourth item


+ First item
+ Second item
+ Third item
    + Indented item
    + Indented item

**Code Blocks**:

Depending on your Markdown processor or editor, youâ€™ll use three backticks (```) or three tildes (~~~) on the lines before and after the code block.
```
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "age": 25
}
```

**Links**:

To create a link, enclose the link text in brackets (e.g., [Duck Duck Go]) and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses (e.g., (https://duckduckgo.com)).

My favorite search engine is [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com).
